# Power BI Navigator

An easier way to navigate Power BI! This extension helps you get to any workspace, dataflow, or dataset more quickly, and adds some color back into Power BI.

Open the Navigator and
- [New Permission] Can now save some settings, like the theme toggle, needs Storage permission to save preferences
- Go to your Home page with "Home"
- Commands looking weird? Run "Refresh Metadata" to make sure you have what you need
- Adds colors to the icons in resource listings

** You can hold shift or control when you press enter or click your mouse to open the selected item in a new tab **

Default shortcut key (use Command instead of Control on Mac, and/or customize your options at chrome://extensions/shortcuts)

Control + Shift + P: Navigator Bar
